## Development Rules

### Responsive Design

Every change to this project must be fully responsive, covering all screen aspects from mobile to 4K monitors. We use a set of custom breakpoints and container classes defined in `app/globals.css` to ensure visual consistency across all devices.

Refer to the [Responsive Design Workflow](.agent/workflows/responsive-design.md) for detailed guidelines.
